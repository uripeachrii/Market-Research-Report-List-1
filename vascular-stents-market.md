<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vascular Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare-Metal Stents</li><li>Drug-Eluting Stents</li><li>Bioabsorbable Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vascular stents market comprises three primary types: bare-metal stents, drug-eluting stents, and bioabsorbable stents. Bare-metal stents serve as simple scaffolds to keep arteries open but can lead to restenosis. Drug-eluting stents are coated with medication to prevent tissue growth and minimize the risk of re-narrowing. Bioabsorbable stents gradually dissolve in the body, providing temporary support while promoting natural healing. Each type caters to specific clinical needs and patient conditions, influencing treatment outcomes in vascular procedures.</p></p>
