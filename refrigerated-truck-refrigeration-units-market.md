<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Refrigerated Truck Refrigeration Units Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Detached</li><li>Dependent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The refrigerated truck refrigeration units market is categorized into two main types: detached and dependent systems. Detached units operate independently, typically mounted on the trailer, allowing flexibility in temperature control and maintenance. They are ideal for long hauls and varying cargo needs. In contrast, dependent units rely on the truck's engine for power, resulting in lower initial costs. However, they offer limited flexibility and cooling capacity, making them suitable for shorter routes with constant temperature requirements.</p></p>
